###
- random quote above textbox
- any vestigial code?

- Is the key matrix the most efficient? lets look deeper! How about KeyDispatch? And is key hit detection as clean as $it could be?
- analyze custom button code vs key matrix detection, is it less efficient? If so can we fix?
- Refactor from the driver/api layer, any efficiency we can gain by rewrites?
- Have Codex refactor the code for compiler efficiency and runtime efficiency. Leave no stone unturned!
- Have Codex refactor the GUI for effiency
- Have Codex redesign the GUI for looks, keeping efficiency
