## TODO
- start windows port
- not sure it should be able to go into gesture mode during typing intent/typing granil
- sometimes 2 finger taps types letters when 1 or more finger is on a key. I need to find a way to prevent this without affecting quick typing where rolling keys often have 1+ fingers touching briefly at once. it appears 2 finger taps trigger "gest" and then it immediately shows "typing" when 2 fingers tap the trackpad at the exact same time. here is the output of our debug trace:
###
- normalize % to px??
- Have Codex refactor the GUI for effiency
- Have Codex redesign the GUI for looks, keeping efficiency
###
- "Auto" set column x,y based on finger splay "4 finger touch" snapsMetro.
