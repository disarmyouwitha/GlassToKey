# GlassToKey

## Intention
An attempt to use the Apple Magic Trackpad as a keyboard (and mouse!) like the TouchStream LP~
Since it is built on the same technology, I thought it would be fun to try and create an open source version!

It's just Codex and I vibe coding~ You can submit an issue but this is really just a repo for me, you might have to fork and extend!

## Usage

Build the GlassToKey project and you are good to go! A Green circle will appear in the OSX status bar indicating that Typing is allowed.

Clicking the indicator light will allow you to view the Config or Quit the program.
